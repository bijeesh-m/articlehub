  "category": "Backend",
  "content": "Node.js is a powerful runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows developers to build fast and scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server side. It provides an event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O which makes it efficient and lightweight.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Node.js is its single-threaded, event-driven architecture that handles many connections concurrently. This makes it perfect for I/O-heavy operations, such as API services and real-time applications.\n\nDevelopers use Node.js in production to build REST APIs, WebSockets, streaming services, command-line tools, and even full-stack applications when paired with frontend frameworks like React.\n\nIn this article, we explore how Node.js works under the hood, common use-cases, and its role in modern backend development. We also look into best practices, scalability techniques, and useful npm modules that can streamline your development workflow.",

With hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, developers can manage state and lifecycle methods without needing class components.\n\nHooks promote cleaner, more readable code and allow better logic reuse by encapsulating functionality into custom hooks. They have replaced class components in most modern React applications.\n\nThis article walks you through real-world examples and patterns to effectively use hooks in your projects. We'll also discuss common pitfalls, debugging techniques, and how to organize your codebase for scalability and testability.\n\nBy the end, you'll be confident in building full-featured apps using nothing but functional components and hooks.",

  "category": "Database",
  "content": "Aggregation in MongoDB allows for powerful data transformation and analytics. It uses a pipeline architecture where data passes through a sequence of stages like `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, and more.\n\nThis makes it easy to filter, group, reshape, and compute values directly inside MongoDB without requiring application logic. It's widely used for building dashboards, reports, and filtering large datasets.\n\nThis article breaks down each stage with real-world use-cases and performance considerations. You’ll learn how to optimize queries using indexes, deal with nested documents, and how to use the `$lookup` stage for joins.\n\nWhether you're building analytics features or simply want to reduce server-side computation, MongoDB aggregation is a must-have skill for any backend developer.",
